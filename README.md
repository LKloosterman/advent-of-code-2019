# advent-of-code-2019

I decided to complete last year's Advent of Code (2019) in order to learn Python
and have something to do during COVID-19 self-isolation!

This is a repository of my solutions, they are organized by level and written in
Python 3. Each level has at two parts so I've separated the parts into different
files, although part two usually just builds upon the solution for part one.

Lastly, this is being done for personal learning experience, so if you know
Python better than I do and you want to teach me something or show me how
something can be done better, please make an issue and provide (constructive)
criticism; I love code review!

Shout out and thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/) for creating
Advent of Code, and keeping past years' challenges up to use as structured
practice!

Psst; If you want to check out Advent of Code for yourself, it's available
